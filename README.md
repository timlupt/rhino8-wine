# rhino8-wine

Patches and instructions to run **Rhinoceros 8** on Linux under Wine 11.9.

Rhino 8 uses .NET 8 via Microsoft's CLR, which has requirements that Wine doesn't meet out of the box. Six distinct problems had to be solved to get it working:

1. **.NET 8 requires ~512MB of reserved stack space** — Wine defaults to 1MB. Patched `ntdll` to force 512MB stacks on all threads.
2. **.NET calibrates recursion depth from `VirtualQuery`** — with a 512MB stack it would try to use all of it and overflow. Patched `ntdll` to clamp the reported stack size to 1MB so .NET calibrates correctly.
3. **Stack overflow exception frames couldn't be delivered** — with large stacks the guard page was too close to the stack bottom to fit an exception frame. Moved the guard page to +64KB.
4. **Dark mode detection caused 254,955-deep mutual recursion** — `rhcommon_c.dll`'s `RHC_RhOSInDarkMode` and the managed `get_DarkMode()` called each other indefinitely on Wine. Fixed with a binary patch to make it always return light mode.
5. **Wine can't verify Microsoft Authenticode signatures** — missing CA root store causes installer verification to fail. Patched `wintrust` to return success while still populating certificate state.
6. **OAuth licensing callback (port 1717) never bound** — stale `http.sys` state from a previous run blocked the port. Fixed by killing the wineserver before launch.

See [WINE_PORTING_NOTES.md](WINE_PORTING_NOTES.md) for a detailed writeup of each problem.

## Setup (Arch Linux)

### 1. Install build dependencies

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed \
  base-devel git \
  mingw-w64-gcc \
  autoconf bison flex perl python \
  lib32-glibc lib32-gcc-libs \
  vulkan-headers \
  fontconfig freetype2 gnutls libxcomposite libxcursor libxdamage \
  libxext libxfixes libxi libxinerama libxrandr libxrender libxxf86vm \
  mesa opencl-icd-loader openssl pcsclite sdl2 v4l-utils \
  vulkan-icd-loader wayland gst-plugins-base-libs libcups libpcap libpulse
```

### 2. Build and install the patched Wine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ItHasLegs/rhino8-wine
cd rhino8-wine
makepkg -si
```

Clones Wine at the tested commit, applies the patches, builds (~20–40 min), and installs to `/opt/wine-rhino8`. Your system Wine is untouched.

### 3. Set up the wineprefix

**Option A — Copy from another machine:**

```bash
rsync -av --progress user@sourcehost:~/.local/share/wineprefixes/rhino8/ \
    ~/.local/share/wineprefixes/rhino8/
```

Then re-apply the `rhcommon_c.dll` patch (step 4).

**Option B — Fresh Rhino install:**

```bash
export WINEPREFIX=~/.local/share/wineprefixes/rhino8
export WINE=/opt/wine-rhino8/bin/wine

WINEPREFIX=$WINEPREFIX WINEDEBUG=-all $WINE wineboot
$WINE vc_redist.x64.exe /quiet
$WINE RhinoInstaller.exe
```

### 4. Apply the rhcommon_c.dll binary patch

Rhino ships `rhcommon_c.dll` — you already have it from the installer. Patch your local copy:

```bash
DLL="$HOME/.local/share/wineprefixes/rhino8/drive_c/Program Files/Rhino 8/System/rhcommon_c.dll"
cp "$DLL" "$DLL.bak"
printf '\x31\xc0\xc3\x90\x90\x90\x90' | \
    dd of="$DLL" bs=1 seek=$((16#dff50)) conv=notrunc
```

This replaces the `RHC_RhOSInDarkMode` JMP thunk with `xor eax,eax; ret` (always returns light mode), preventing the mutual recursion crash.

### 5. Run Rhino

```bash
./run-rhino.sh
```

If the licensing OAuth flow fails (Firefox redirects to `http://127.0.0.1:1717/` and gets "can't connect"), run:

```bash
./run-rhino.sh --fresh
```

This kills and restarts the wineserver, resetting the internal HTTP server state that handles the OAuth callback.
